## Business Idea

## 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Multivariate Classification
This repository contains code for implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for multivariate classification using Keras and TensorFlow. The model is designed to work with multivariate datasets, where each instance has multiple features.
